## Installation

This project provides two main installation methods to cover most Linux users:

---

### 1. Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives — install the `.deb` package

If you’re on Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS, or any Debian-based distro:

1. Download the `.deb` package `asana-linux_1.0.0_amd64.deb`.
2. Install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./asana-linux_1.0.0_amd64.deb
   ```

3. Launch Asana from your app menu or by running:

   ```bash
   asana-linux
   ```

---

### 2. Other distros (Arch, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc.) — use the AppImage

If you’re on Arch Linux, Fedora, or other distros, use the AppImage:

1. Download the AppImage file `Asana-Linux-1.0.0.AppImage`
2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x Asana-Linux-1.0.0.AppImage
   ```

3. Run it directly:

   ```bash
   ./Asana-linux-1.0.0.AppImage
   ```
---

## Notes

- `.deb` packages provide native integration and easier updates on Debian-based distros.
- AppImage is a universal, portable binary that runs on nearly all Linux distros without installation.
- Choose the method that fits your distro and preferences.
